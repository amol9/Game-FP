I had installed the Epic Games Software some time ago. I had installed it and had chosen to install the Unreal Engine from it. Then, I had forgotten about the software. It had been running in the background, possibly, I had seen the software icon in the system tray. I had killed it, on account of the thought that it may have been consuming a lot of bandwidth. Today, I checked the software and found out that the Unreal Engine has been installed. I launched it. Since the college days, I have played games. I have been interested in developing games. Today, now that the engine has been installed, I might try it. Some kind of studio has launched. I have selected the 'First Person' project type. I think, the software will let me create the 'First Person' world, and, then, let me see if I can develop game on top of it, using code.

I have tested the basic operation of the software. It has created a basic FP (First Person) world, with some objects. I could move my mouse and see the world. The world seems to have boundaries. It seems to be a small one, with some kind of ground and walls, and a platform. I may be able to add objects to this and may be able to expand this world. I am not going to do that now. I played the world, by clicking the 'Play' button. It played. I could play in this world like I played some actual games. The standard keyboard bindings were already present, like, up, down, left, right movement keys using the arrow keys, I could even jump, using the standard space bar binding. The movement seems good, there seems to be more to this, this may be newer, the environment movement, upon my movement seems more interesting, it is faster.

I am going to stop now. I'll continue later.
